# Angle Health Frontend Interview Project

In order to complete this project, you will need to run an API locally through Docker. Instructions are located in `api/README.md`.

Please complete the features below. There is no design provided, so styling is optional but welcome (not the focus). We primarily use React Boostrap and styled-components, but feel free to use the libraries/tools you are most familiar with. Please write your code in Typescript.

## Features

- User should be able to view a table of members (including member name, email and phone number), pulling from the API
- User should be able to add a new member (using the form in `NewMemberModal.tsx`)
  - New member should immediately display in the table on successful creation
- User should be able to delete a member
- User should be able to sort members by name and email
- User should be able to filter members by name, email, and phone number

Please don't hesitate to reach out to valerie@anglehealth.com if you have questions. Looking forward to meeting!
